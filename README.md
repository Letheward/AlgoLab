# AlgoLab

C playground and memo for experimenting with random stuff (algorithms, performance, style, utility functions, etc.).

Code quality is very low and there may be serious bugs, but if you find some of them useful, just copy them to your code and do whatever you want, no library/license hassle. 

## How to build

Read the code first, some files have their own build instructions.

But for most files, just invoke your compiler from terminal and compile, like:
~~~ sh
gcc string.c && ./a
~~~
