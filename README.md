# AlgoLab

C playground and memo for experimenting with random stuff (algorithms, performance, style, utility functions, etc).

Code quality is very low, but results from experiments may have some value to other people.

## How to build

Just invoke your compiler from terminal and compile a single file, like:
~~~ sh
gcc print.c && ./a
~~~
